INSURANCE COST PREDICTION LINEAR REGRESSION PROJECT üöóüìä
OVERVIEW
This project aims to create a Linear Regression model to predict insurance-related costs. Various Python libraries were employed for data analysis and model construction.

USED LIBRARIES üìö
pandas - Data manipulation.
numpy - Mathematical operations support.
seaborn - Statistical data visualization.
sklearn.preprocessing - Data preprocessing.
statsmodels.formula.api - Statistical model construction.
sklearn.model_selection - Train-test set selection.
sklearn.linear_model - Implementation of linear regression models.
sklearn.ensemble - Used for ensemble models such as RandomForest, AdaBoost, and GradientBoosting.
GridSearchCV - Hyperparameter optimization.
CODE FEATURES üõ†Ô∏è
Handling Missing Data:

Specific approach for dealing with missing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Use of graphs and statistics to understand data distribution.
Data Preprocessing:

Encoding categorical variables.
Data normalization with MinMaxScaler.
Train-Test Set Split:

Separation of data for model training and evaluation.
Model Construction and Evaluation:

Use of Linear Regression and ensemble models (RandomForest, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting).
