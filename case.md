# **INSURANCE COST PREDICTION LINEAR REGRESSION PROJECT** üöóüìä

## **OVERVIEW**

This project aims to create a Linear Regression model to predict insurance-related costs. Various Python libraries were employed for data analysis and model construction.

## **USED LIBRARIES** üìö

- `pandas` - Data manipulation.
- `numpy` - Mathematical operations support.
- `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization.
- `sklearn.preprocessing` - Data preprocessing.
- `statsmodels.formula.api` - Statistical model construction.
- `sklearn.model_selection` - Train-test set selection.
- `sklearn.linear_model` - Implementation of linear regression models.
- `sklearn.ensemble` - Used for ensemble models such as RandomForest, AdaBoost, and GradientBoosting.
- `GridSearchCV` - Hyperparameter optimization.

## **CODE FEATURES** üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Handling Missing Data:**
   - Specific approach for dealing with missing data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Use of graphs and statistics to understand data distribution.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Data normalization with `MinMaxScaler`.

4. **Train-Test Set Split:**
   - Separation of data for model training and evaluation.

5. **Model Construction and Evaluation:**
   - Use of Linear Regression and ensemble models (RandomForest, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting).
   - Performance evaluation using metrics such as MSE and R¬≤.

6. **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
   - Application of GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
